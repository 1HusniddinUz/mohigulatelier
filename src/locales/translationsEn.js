  about_title: "Hi, I’m Idiyeva Mohigul.",
  about_p1:
    "I’m a textile artist and embroidery designer who has been working with traditional Uzbek needlework since 2017. My work reimagines classic patterns for today’s lifestyle, turning them into modern bags, caps, accessories and home pieces that feel both familiar and refreshingly new.",
  about_p2:
    "Every piece starts with a story: a memory from Bukhara, a suzani motif, or a detail from everyday life. I carefully translate these elements into minimal, wearable designs so that heritage doesn’t remain locked in a chest at home, but walks with you through your daily routine.",
  about_p3:
    "Quality and meaning are at the heart of what I do. I work in small batches, using hand embroidery and thoughtful construction so that each product is both functional and a keepsake. My aim is simple: to help you carry a piece of our culture with you in a quiet, elegant and contemporary way.",
